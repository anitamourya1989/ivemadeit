							<p align="center"><em>My client Monisha was frustrated as she could not find good organic cotton clothes for her new born baby.  She could not go back to work as she did not have someone to look after the baby.  She lost interest in dressing up or going out.  We met by chance and was sparked with our initial discussion. Helping other moms resonated with her so decided go back to work and make money to start her business. Every weekend she spend working on her business plan and do fun stuff with family. Her online business is launched and she Made It!</em></p>

							<!-- <p>When your will power is dynamic, your silent slogan is: “I will continue my efforts until I achieve my goal, no matter how difficult the task.” Soon you achieve equilibrium. </p> -->

							<blockquote>
								<p><i>“A coach is someone who understands and works with the coachee to achieve the goals. I see Anita's approach as action-driven with an in-depth knowledge. It is amazing to be in session with Anita as she navigates through complex human emotions, situations and jumbled thoughts and in a sentence a new world of opportunities would open up for me.  My experience with her is very unique and am now hopeful of my future as a new migrant to Canada”.<br><strong>- R Kodali - Ex-VP Information Technology - R. R. Donnelly</strong></i>
