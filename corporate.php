                        <li>'I've Made It' seeks to discover the signals that create the patterns of success inherent within everyone.</li>
                        <li>'I've Made It'  wants to explore significant possibilities of what every individual is capable of vis a vis merely questioning of what they don't have.          
                        <li> 'I've Made It'  requires imagination and openness as prerequisites to recreate the success cycle, giving ourselves permission and the freedom to explore. </li>
                        <li>'I've Made It' encourages to remember that we forget the daily success in our lives which we might not regard as great accomplishments. </li>
