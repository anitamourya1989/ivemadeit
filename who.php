								<p><h4>Organization Percolates Vision Globally : USA</h4></p>

								<p>Life Fitness International operates on a global basis with a diverse management team located in the company&rsquo;s Tokyo, London, Rotterdam and Hong Kong offices. The senior team at Life Fitness needed thought provoking, challenging as well as creative ideas to implement the 2010 vision for the company&rsquo;s international operations. With the leadership team working in 3 different continents, it was critical to align everyone on understanding principles of Leadership from Within and how it directly co-relates to creating the conditions for sustained success. The content and delivery was multi- dimensional as it had depth, practical value as well challenged the current understanding on leadership to bring about new understanding shared by the team.</p>

								<p>The coaching sessions following the training infused life and fostered deep understanding and collaboration among leaders.</p>

								<p>We would recommend I&#39;ve Made It and Ms. Sachdev to any corporation who wants to provide a new approach, depth and meaning to existing ideas and percolate them effectively.</p>

								<p><h4>Executive Coaching</h4></p>

								<p>&quot;I have known Anita Sachdev for several years as a friend and as a coach. She has become highly effective in the personal and professional development sphere. She is a smart, feel-good personality, with an infectious smile, and an optimistic spirit. She constantly refines her understanding of human needs.</p>

								<p>&nbsp;A few years ago, when I was faced with a personal crisis, she listened carefully, asked intuitive questions, and helped me evaluate and work through the situation until we found a solution. I was encouraged by her skill and her deep understanding of the complexity of the situation. She broke it down and helped me look at rational options.&nbsp; Her guidance, as a professional coach over a period of time helped me overcome the hurdle! &rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

								<p>I feel the best thing about working with Anita as an Executive Coach was I consciously began to understand what was sub-consciously known to me. This gave super clarity to my thoughts and actions. She held the mirror in front of me, which led me on the path to self-discovery and thereafter, the Law of Karma took over.</p>

								<p>Anita is a very perceptive, generous coach, who correctly and quickly assesses the needs of her clients to ensure they get the best out of the coaching experience as a whole, and out of every session. A knowledgeable professional in her field, I have found her approach to help me problem solve and decision making were useful. Alongside short-term results, she has been very focused on the bigger picture, how to efficiently use my strengths, and develop long-term sustainable solutions to become an effective leader. I am very happy to have found Anita, and am finding the coaching experience under her tutelage extremely beneficial to all aspects of my life so important when living in a new country”.</p>
