						<p><i>The meaning of the word facilitator apparently comes from the Latin word facilitas meaning 'easiness' and the verb facilitate means 'to make easy, promote, help forward'. ... In this respect, facilitation is generally about 'holding out a helping hand, removing obstacles and generally creating a smooth pathway for the delegates to pursue their learning journey'.</i></p>

					<h3>Facilitative Approach and Process</h3>
					<span class="topup">[<a href="#navtop">top</a>]</span>
					<div class="clearfix"></div>

					<p><strong><em>I&rsquo;ve Made It facilitation, training, coaching support participants to Gain a Voice of Clarity and Self-Realization with deep understanding they have Made It before and with confidence believe they have what it takes to face the future.</em></strong></p>

					<p>Ingrid Bens (2005) philosophy and approach as Facilitators is an integral part of my belief system and expresses itself at all times viz:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Grounded in a sincere respect for all group members regardless of their age, rank or cultural group.</li>
						<li>Everyone possesses innate wisdom that can be harnessed and channeled for the good of the whole.</li>
						<li>Facilitation activities aim to foster co-operation and commitment.</li>
						<li>Value the synergistic power of collective thought and strive to help groups arrive at a collaborative decision that represents a win for all parties.</li>
						<li>Simple and organic process that interweaves timeless teachings with one&#39;s Personal Power Centre to address future opportunities and challenges.</li>
						<li>Taps into judgment, creativity, intelligence, insights which have filtered into experiences to date and transforms it into knowledge and confidence.</li>
						<li>Shifts lens and perspectives to gain clarity to manage ambiguous situations</li>
					</ul><br>

					<p><strong><em>We use methodology and approach which is pragmatic and aligned with group needs. Depending on the maturity of the group, the subject matter, group mix, space arrangements, we pick facilitation, training or a facilitation/Training combo delivery method.&nbsp; &nbsp;</em></strong></p>
