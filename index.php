    </h3>
    ‘I’ve Made It’ recognizes that the workplace in which people are trying to secure their livelihood has undergone a transformation. Recent advances in information and communications technologies, immigration, global virtual offices, have begun to accelerate the rate of change in the workplace, making it volatile and unpredictable. So our work environment adds pressure to learn new things everyday to stay ahead. Therefore, we have to undergo a transformation in order to survive and succeed in an uncertain future. And there’s more…
    <br /><br />
    Forever, success has been defined by external experiences. We have let external forces determine who we really are, in relation to ourselves, and the corporate world. We seek the thrill of accomplishments tirelessly, using competitiveness as the ultimate tool. We succumb to the unconscious need to prove our capability to meet and exceed the standards set by others. <br /><br />
    Once you grasp that authentic evolution is not a matter of winning, but taking pride in progress AT OUR OWN PACE, the YOU is reflected in the WE, (teams, family) which in turn positively affects ALL (World)<br /><br />
