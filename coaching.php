                     <h3>Career Coaching Definition</h3>
                     <span class="topup">[<a href="#">top</a>]</span>
                     <div class="clearfix"></div>
                     <p>The formal definition of career coaching from the International Federation of Coaching (ICF) states that a career coach partners with you in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires you to maximize your personal and professional potential.</p>
                     <p>Coaches honor you as the expert in your life and work and believe you are creative, resourceful and whole. The core virtue of career coaching is to help people assess their professional situations with a greater degree of curiosity, empathy and compassion to: </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Discover, clarify, and align with goal</li>
                        <li>Encourage self-discovery</li>
                        <li>Elicit solutions and strategies</li>
                        <li>Hold you responsible and accountable</li>
                     </ul><br>
                     <p>This process helps clients dramatically shift their attitudes, beliefs, about themselves and their potential to pursue a career linked with their innermost passion.</p>
                     <h3>What does a Career Coach do?</h3>
                     <p>Your coach supports you through your journey in a fair, mature and balanced way to making achievement a matter of habit. Warm encouragement and a customized system will help you execute, believing anything is possible! It's all up to you.</p>
                     <p>Coach helps you focus on :</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Your vision, dreams and strategize how you wish to achieve them.</li>
                        <li>Examine and clarify your needs, values and beliefs and develop the goals, sub-goals and micro goals that help you grow - personally and professionally.</li>
                        <li>Define the issues you face, understand the possible causes that can stand in your way of success</li>
                        <li>Deep Dive to understand, analyze and identify solutions to your challenges and helps you accelerate the path to your destination.</li>
                     </ul><br>
                     <p>Remember in the journey, you will cruise or stumble upon obstacles. The Coach will navigate and explore options that may not be top-of-mind for you. The journey will take you through a period of change, stress or growth with clarity and confidence from where you are today, to where you want to be into the future.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 13px;"><i>Transition from Job to Entrepreneur</i></h3>
                        <p><i>I was under the impression that after working for over 15 years in US embassy at key positions; my experience and insight on my priorities and direction I wanted my career to take. That is why Anita surprised me when she was able to walk me through ‘her values process' in such a short time with dramatic results. Anita had a way to see beyond what I was seeing. She asked the right questions that evoked a new awareness in me. She is amazingly dedicated to her work, highly motivated & result oriented professional and motivates you to bring clarity in your thought process too.</i></p>

                        <p><i>Innovation and creativity is running through her veins and she is a master of provoking new ideas. She kinda got me thinking about designing an exercise which sparked a completely new thought process and a renewed sense of purpose. I know now without a doubt what direction my business needs to go in order for me to be happy and prosper. Even if you think you know what your values are; I would highly recommend that you follow Anita’s process and witness for yourself what new awareness is in store for you!</i> <i><strong>- J Sapra</strong></i></p>
