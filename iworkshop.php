               "The workshop made me understand what my core strengths are and how
               best to use my talents. Anita's insightful and warm style made it a
               fun and enriching experiencing. What I learned in her workshop will
               certainly help me become even more successful in the future." <br />-  Noomi

               "The workshop in a simple way helps you realize that, haphazard though
               it may appear, there is a thread of commonality that connects your
               past triumphs and milestones, which once established, should form the
               essence of any future milestone in order for it to be successful and
               to resonate with your inner self" <br />  -Sushma Gaikwad
