						<blockquote>
							<!-- <h3 style="font-size: 13px;"><i>Transition from Job to Entrepreneur</i></h3> -->
							<p><i>When preparing for an expat assignment to India, one of my chief concerns regarded the culture gap between India and the US. In order to be effective, I needed an awareness of cultural differences as well as a strategy for dealing with them. Anita’s training raised my appreciation of the role culture plays in business and personal communication. She provided excellent tools and techniques for me to use to help overcome or minimize potential problems. </i></p>
							<p><i>She guided our sessions with ease, In retrospect, the conversational environment Anita built was an essential component that allowed us to cover a number of topics thoroughly in a short period of time.   Her commitment to ensure that cultural issues are explored, understood, and actionable by her clients cannot be overstated. While I admit that ~any~ cross cultural training may be helpful, I can say that her sessions were outstanding.  </i></p>

							<p><i>Subsequently, Anita helped developed cross cultural competencies for my team with success.  I have no hesitation recommending Anita for cultural consulting opportunities. After putting the lessons she taught in practice over the past year, I’m a believer. I would not have been nearly as effective in my role without her training, and have nothing but the highest praise for the service she provided.</i> <br>
